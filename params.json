{"name":"SynergyChrome","tagline":"Bookmarklets that gives Synergy basic support for Chrome.","body":"# Description\r\n\r\nThe VBS version of the webapplication Synergy only works on IE 8 natively, or IE > 8 with manually modifying the compatibility settings.\r\nThis bookmarklet supplies some basic functionality in Chrome (tested) and probably Safari and Firefox too (untested).\r\n\r\nJust startup Synergy and run the bookmarklet.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n1. I will assume you use Chrome (tested with 36) for all steps\r\n1. make a bookmark of this link: [the bookmarklet (v 0.9.3)]() (right-click, Bookmark this link)\r\n1. log into Synergy\r\n1. go to Mijn realisaties > wekelijks. This will give a loading screen that doesn't disappear.\r\n1. click the bookmark, changes should be visible immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Status\r\n\r\n## What will work\r\n\r\n* submitting hours (untested)\r\n* saving hours\r\n* previous button\r\n* next button\r\n* search for hour code (the infamous F2)\r\n* in search window: entire row clickable\r\n* table on main window narrower\r\n* provide debug info by typing in console: synergyChrome.info\r\n* when focussing on \"Uur/Artikel\", prefill PRUUR\r\n* automatic loading of this script after a load\r\n\r\n## What doesn't work (yet)\r\n\r\n* test submitting hours\r\n* improve the jquery detection: it is now possible to have jquery injected several times. Before injecting, test if it already exists (in addJquery)\r\n* enable keyboard shortcut: S (save hours)\r\n* before running, detect if synergy is open\r\n* anything else...\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
